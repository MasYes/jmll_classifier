[v circuits for some large tools and air compressor circuits don t overload circuits and don t use extension cords if you can help it unless they re rated for high currents a coiled extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of the same gauge also the insulation won t withstand as much heat and heat dissipation is the critical issue if your shop is located at some remove from your main panel you should probably install a subpanel and derive your shop wiring from it if you have young children you may want to equip this panel with a cut off switch and possibly a lock if you want to install individual switches to safe particular circuits make sure you get ones rated high enough for example ordinary light switches are not safely able to handle the start up surge generated by a table saw buy horsepower rated switches instead finally note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished basements hence the nec requirements for gfcis apply and even if you know that you d never use one of your shop outlets to run a lawn mower the next owner of your house might have a different idea note fine woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop wiring april is one place to start subject underground wiring you will need to prepare a trench to specifications use special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tubing and possibly lumber don t use creosoted lumber it rots thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion of lead the transition from in house to underground wire is generally via conduit all outdoor boxes must be specifically listed for the purpose and contain the appropriate gaskets fittings etc if the location of the box is subject to immersion in water a more serious style of water proof box is needed and of course don t forget the gfcis the required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specific situation a hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says buried power line and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed subject aluminum wiring during the s aluminum instead of copper wiring became quite popular and was extensively used since that time aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations we recommend even if you re allowed to that do not use it for new wiring but don t panic if your house has aluminum wiring aluminum wiring when properly installed can be just as safe as copper aluminum wiring is however very unforgiving of improper installation we will cover a bit of the theory behind potential problems and what you can do to make your wiring safe the main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as cold creep when aluminum wiring warms up it expands when it cools down it contracts unlike copper when aluminum goes through a number of warm cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each time to make the problem worse aluminum oxidises or corrodes when in contact with certain types of metal so the resistance of the connection goes up which causes it to heat up and corrode oxidize still more eventually the wire may start getting very hot melt the insulation or fixture it s attached to and possibly even cause a fire since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move into a house built during the s we will cover basic points of safe aluminum wiring we suggest that if you re considering purchasing a home with aluminum wiring or have discovered it later that you hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring for the following things fixtures eg outlets and switches directly attached to aluminum wiring should be rated for it the device will be stamped with al cu or co alr the latter supersedes the former but both are safe these fixtures are somewhat more expensive than the ordinary ones wires should be properly connected at least way around the screw in a clockwise direction connections should be tight while repeated tightening of the screws can make the problem worse during the inspection it would pay off to snug up each connection note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the main service entrance cable it should be inspected push in terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire any connections using push in terminals should be redone with the proper screw connections immediately there should be no signs of overheating darkened connections melted insulation or baked fixtures any such damage should be repaired connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be handled specially current canadian codes require that the wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting aluminum to copper the nec requires that the wire be connected together using special crimp devices with an anti oxidant grease the tools and materials for the latter are quite expensive not practical to do it yourself unless you can rent the tool any non rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring by means of a short copper pigtail see above shows reasonable workmanship neat wiring properly stripped not nicked wire etc if when considering purchasing a home an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two we believe that you can consider the wiring safe if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere if the wrong receptacles are used you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtails having this professionally done can range from to per receptacle switch you can do this yourself too subject i m buying a house what should i do congratulations but it s generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas not just for wiring but plumbing and structural as well if an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor ones we believe that you can consider the wiring safe after any minor problems are fixed if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere here s some hints on what to look for obvious non code wiring can include zip cord wiring either concealed or nailed to walls hot wiring on the identified neutral conductor without proper marking ungrounded grounding outlets except when downstream of a gfci splices hanging in mid air other than proper knob and tube switched neutrals unsecured romex swinging about like grapevines certain wiring practises that are actually to code or were at one time sometimes reveal diy wiring that may have hidden violations switches that seem to control nothing abandoned perhaps not properly terminated wiring a wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are separately controlled by other wall switches except when it s really convenient switches and outlets in bizarre locations great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or ceiling backwrapped grounding wires subject what is this weird stuff old style wiring in the years since edison invented electricity several different wiring styles have come and gone when you buy an older home you may encounter some of this stuff this section describes the old methods and some of their idiosyncrasies the oldest wiring system you re likely to encounter is called knob and tube k t it is made up of individual conductors with a cloth insulation the wires are run along side structural members eg joists or studs using ceramic stand offs knobs wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes connections were made by twisting the wire together soldering and wrapping with tape since the hot and neutral were run separately the wiring tends to be rather confusing a neutral often runs down the centre of each room with taps off to each fixture the hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next in some cases k t isn t colour coded so the neutral is often the same colour as the hot wires you ll see k t in homes built as late as the s comments on k t the people installing k t were pretty paranoid about electricity so the workmanship tends to be pretty good the wire insulation and insulators tend to stand up very well most k t i ve seen for example is in quite good condition no grounding grounding is usually difficult to install boxes are small receptacle replacement particularly with gfci can be difficult no bushing on boxes either so wiring changes need special attention to box entry sometimes the neutral isn t balanced very well between separately hot circuits so it is sometimes possible to overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on any circuit building code does not permit insulation in walls that contain k t connection to existing k t from new circuits can be tricky consult your inspector modern wiring practise requires considerably more outlets to be installed than k t systems did since k t tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn t necessary to replace it simply because it s k t what you should watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and be cautious about circuit loading in many cases it s perfectly reasonable to leave existing k t alone and add new fixtures on new circuits using modern techniques after k t they invented multi conductor cable the first type you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation it looks much like the romex cable of the last decade or two this stuff was used in the s and s again no grounding conductor it was installed much like modern wiring its major drawback is that this type of insulation embrittles we ve seen whole systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a touch bx cable of the same vintage has similar problems this stuff is very fragile and becomes rather hazardous if the wires become bare this wiring should be left untouched as much as possible whenever an opportunity arises replace it a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat shrink tubing after this wiring technique the more modern romex was invented it s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth often a bit sticky this stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn t present a hazard and is reasonably easy to work with it does not need to be replaced it should be considered as safe as the modern stuff thermoplastic insulation wire just don t abuse it too much subject where do i buy stuff try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you their prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or diy centres have better quality materials have wider variety including the odd stuff and have people behind the counter that know what you re talking about cultivate friendly knowledgeable sales people they ll give you much valuable information chris lewis clewis ferret ocunix on ca phone canada psroff info

[armenians i heard this before that i hadn t been listening to the speeches closely many people spoke and i stood with my back to the podium talking shop with the other teachers and somehow it all went right by it didn t penetrate that in fact something serious was taking place then when one of our teachers said listen to what he s saying listen to what idiocy he s spouting we listened that was the speech of that director before that we listened to the woman s speech right then in our group there were nine of us the mood changed and the subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten our director of studies for whom i had great respect he s an azerbaijani before that i had considered him an upstanding and worthy person if there was a need to obtain leave we had asked him he seemed like a good person so he tells me lyuda you know that besides you there are no armenians on the square if they find out that you re an armenian they ll tear you to pieces should i tell them you re an armenian should i tell them you re an armenian when he said it the first time i pretended not to hear it and then he asked me a second time i turned to the director khudurova and said that it was already after eight i was expected at home and i should be leaving she answered no they said that women should stay here until ten o clock and men until twelve stay here there was a young teacher with us her children were in kindergarten and her husband worked shifts she asked to leave i left my children at the kindergarten the director excused her when she let her go i turned around said good bye and left with the young teacher the azerbaijani i didn t see them after that when we were walking the buses weren t running and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us they had apparently gotten all fired up it must have become too much for them and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately so they rushed off i wasn t afraid this time because i was sure that the other teacher wouldn t say that i was an armenian to make it short we reached home then karina told of how they had been at the movies and what had happened there i started telling of my experience and again my parents didn t understand that we were in danger we watched television as usual and didn t even imagine that tomorrow would be our last day that s how it all was at the city party committee i met an acquaintance we went to school together zhanna i don t remember her last name she lives above the housewares store on narimanov street she was there with her father for some reason she doesn t have a mother the two of them were at home alone while her father held the door she jumped from the third floor and she was lucky that the ground was wet and that there wasn t anyone behind the building when she went out on the balcony there was no one there they were all standing near the entryway that building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders there she jumped she jumped and didn t feel any pain in the heat of the moment a few days later i found out that she couldn t stand up she had been injured somehow that s how people in sumgait saved their lives their honor and their children any way they could where it was possible the armenians fought back my father s first cousin armen m lives in block they found out by phone from one of the victims what was going on in town the armenians in that building all called one another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes knives even with muskets and went up to the roof they took their infants with them and their old women who had been in bed for god knows how many months they got them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs they hooked electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited ready to fight then they took the daughter of the school board director hostage she s an azerbaijani who lived in their building they called the school board director and told her that if she didn t help them the armenians on the roof to escape alive and unharmed she d never see her daughter again i m sure of course that armenians would never lay a hand on a woman it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time she called the police the armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town two armored personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned they surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof and off to the side from the armored personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that very moment into block that s how they defended themselves i heard that our neighbors roman and sasha gambarian resisted they re big strong guys their father was killed and i heard that the brothers put up a strong defense and lost their father but were able to save their mother one of the neighbors told me that after it happened when they were looking for the criminals on march to and detaining everyone they suspected people hid people in our entryway maybe people who were injured or perhaps dead the neighbors themselves were afraid to go there and when they went with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found azerbaijani corpses i don t know how many even if they had been wounded and put down there after two days they would have died from loss of blood or infection that basement was filled with water i heard this from the neighbors and later when i was talking with the investigators the subject came up and they confirmed it i know too that for several hours the basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment and our neighbor carried out our carpet along with the rest he stole it for himself posing as one of the criminals everyone was taking his own share and the neighbor took his too and carried it home and when we came back when everything seemed to have calmed down he returned it saying that it was the only thing of ours he had managed to save raya s husband and father defended themselves the trdatovs defended themselves and so did other armenian families to be sure there were azerbaijani victims although we ll never hear anything about them for some reason our government doesn t want to say that the armenians were not just victims but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers too in the tv show pozitsiya viewpoint a military man an officer said that the armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves but that s not important the truth will come out regardless so that s the price we paid those three days for three days our courage our bravery and our humanity was tested it was those three days and not the years and dozens of years we had lived before them that showed what we ve become what we grew up to be those three days showed who was who on that i will conclude my narrative on the sumgait tragedy it should be said that it s not over yet the trials are still ahead of us and the punishments received by those who so violated us who wanted to make us into nonhumans will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators the procuracy and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga tion that s the price we paid to live in armenia to not fear going out on the street at night to not be afraid to say we re armenians and to not fear speaking our native tongue october yerevan reference
